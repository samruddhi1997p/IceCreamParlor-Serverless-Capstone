# FrostBite Serverless Application

Frostbite is a serverless application built for an ice cream parlor where a user can login, check the menu and place an order. The application is using AWS Lambda, Serverless Framework and REACT.

# Functionality of the application

This application will allow user place an order and view it in the MyOrder section. The user can edit as well as delete the order.


# Frontend

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API that should be developed in the project.

This frontend should work with your serverless application once it is developed, you don't need to make any changes to the code. The only file that you need to edit is the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. This file configures your client application just as it was done in the course and contains an API endpoint and Auth0 configuration:

## Authentication

To implement authentication in your application, you would have to create an Auth0 application and copy "domain" and "client id" to the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. We recommend using asymmetrically encrypted JWT tokens.

# Best practices

To complete this exercise, please follow the best practices from the 6th lesson of this course.

## Logging

The starter code comes with a configured [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logger that creates [JSON formatted](https://stackify.com/what-is-structured-logging-and-why-developers-need-it/) log statements.

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

# Postman collection

An alternative way to test your API, you can use the Postman collection that contains sample requests. You can find a Postman collection in this project. To import this collection, do the following.
